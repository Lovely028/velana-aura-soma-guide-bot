The mystic mysticism really a bottle
about growing.
>> Welcome to my channel. Today I'm in
Camelot and here is please welcome Iris
Rebilas, Aura-soma teacher and
practitioner and the founder of Camelot
Center. Thank you for accepting this
idea. Thank you very much.
>> Yeah, you're welcome. I'm happy. Can you
take us back to the moment when you
first encountered aura-soma and what
was that about the system that truly
spoke to you?
Well, we have to go a long way back
then. It was in 1990
that somebody offered me from a little
bottle few drops of essence at a
seminar with energetic body work.
>> And that lady said to me, you go so so
so you put it in your aura and then you
just feel and what I felt was very
strong. Very
so
>> exciting.
>> Yeah. What is it? and yeah, show me the
little bottle. And I looked at the
little bottle and it said quintessence
and it had an address on it. I wrote
down the address and then wrote to the
company
and I got back some informational
materials and so on and also the
information that the founder of Aura-soma
Vicky Wall had just published her
biography.
>> Oh, interesting.
>> Yeah. So I I got the biography
um and I read it of course but I read it
is a bit exaggerated because actually I
only wrote the uh read the first few
sentences
because they were so intriguing by uh
finding out that she wrote I'm the
seventh child of the seventh child and
the number seven has triggered me my
lifelong
>> because I'm born on the seventh of the
seventh and so there were two sevens
again
>> and I just thought okay this lady
must know my childhood the answer to my
childhood question
sign from the universe
>> which was why am I born on the seventh
of the sevens and I closed the book and
decided I need to meet this lady it was
not really about it was much more Vicky.
And so I mean it wasn't so easy to make
an appointment because she already was
blind. She was uh she was ill and she
was very well protected from the public
so to speak. But I managed
and I went to England to meet the lady
to ask her the question. But of course
at some point I had finished reading the
book and the Aura-soma system intrigued me
and what intrigued me the most was uh
the the mystic mysticism that was
around. I was always interested in in
things that are more happening in the
unseen
>> and how she described how Aura-soma came
into being, how she received the
information
of producing the bottles, of making the
bottles. It's um that was really what I
what pulled me there, so to speak. And
then meeting her was it was very
special. She was a very special lady.
>> And it was uh also
a bit spooky that she said to me, one of
the first things she said to me was,
>> "Why don't you come? Why haven't you
come earlier? Because I called for you."
And I just went oops.
>> Incredible.
>> I I didn't hear anything.
I didn't receive a phone call or a
letter, but well, here I am. And yeah,
kind of these things happened. She also
said, "It's not the first time you're
meeting the system." Actually, you just
need to remember how to work with it.
You've done it before in in other
lifetimes. We've met so many times
before. Aura-soma has been in the world in
different ways already. She always I
said it's new wine and old bottles.
>> So this all of this which wasn't really
tangible from the material point of view
that was really something that
>> that amazing.
>> Aura-soma is often described as color
therapy for the soul. For someone
unfamiliar, how would you describe its
core essence?
Um,
color therapy for the soul means really
that it goes beyond your personality.
We identify very much with what we're
doing, with our professions, with our
status in society or family.
And this is what our focus is on most of
the time. And Aura-som can guide you beyond
this and give you an idea of that we are
more than this.
>> And yeah, what is the more? The more is
actually your soul being.
And because we're choosing our colors
through a level of the eyes actually the
eyes are choosing but the eyes are
connecting with connected through the
brain with our higher self
energetically.
So there is also the aspect of the soul
is choosing the colors or we are chosen
by the soul.
And this is this is quite a complex
concept to understand that we are more
than we think we are and that this more
offers us other aspects of ourselves.
maybe talents, maybe potentials that we
have not yet discovered. Each soul comes
in to this world with a lot of
potential. But the uh the things are
very often covered by education by what
our parents says by what we learn to
believe and the that's something which Aura-soma
can guide you towards that you overcome
your belief systems.
You work with the color, light and
consciousness, right?
>> In your experience, in your vast
experience and consultations for the
people, which colors the most drawn to
these days, to our present day and what
might that reveal about the collective
consciousness?
>> Well, you cannot really put it this way.
Each person will choose the colors that
are the most appropriate ones in the
moment for them.
The aspect that you're touching here
like the universal consciousness or
global consciousness this reflects is
more reflected in when a new bottle
comes in. Okay
>> Because the system is not like set and
from one to 30 or so as you see there
are many many more and we're now with
123
and whenever a
need in mankind is there for a specific
color
>> or when mankind is ready to take the
next step in consciousness to
>> expand consciousness to bring new
aspects into life. Then these colors
appear and
>> that's the message
>> and that's the
>> that's the indicator of collective
consciousness.
>> Exactly. The message of the new bottle
is the indicator of the consciousness
development. Exactly.
And when an individual person comes and
chooses their bottle very often when a
new bottle is there, the new bottle
appears in the selection, but not
always. They always choose what's
appropriate for them for their soul, for
their state of being, soulwise.
>> Iris, you are both Aura-soma teacher and
practitioner.
What's life lesson you learned in color
therapy that left a lasting mark on you
and connecting both your roles
There's not so much of a difference
between those two roles. As a
practitioner, you sit with one person
and you look into an individual life
story or certain
maybe issues, problems. Usually people
come when they have a problem um that
need to be resolved that they want to
have some guidance and because they're
looking at their soul level um there is
a bit of a higher guidance in involved
in when we sit with an individual
person. The teaching role is still the
same because also in our seminars we
work with individual situations because
when you want to learn how to look at
four bottles you need to have examples
and then one person has to have the
courage to put out the bottles and be
examined in a way. Um of course the
teaching is more a generalized thing.
It's not so individual and when you look
at a person's bottle in in the context
of a group, one is maybe a bit more
sensitive towards delicate points that
one can see. But it's for the group very
important to witness
um the process to witness the person and
also maybe see a reflection. That's a
big learning in the seminars. the
reflection that has that are is there
for themselves in another person's
bottles because we're all
interconnected. And for myself,
the outstanding experience
is that when I was little, I was wanted
always to understand
why is a person the way he or she is?
Why does the person behave? So and so
why is a person especially sad which
touched me always as a child and I
wanted to understand where the sadness
came from
or the anger and so this is for me the
greatest gift that uh I can understand
people better through aura-soma,
empathy to see their point of view um in
non-judgmental way. Learning to let them
be as they want to be
to present themselves. That's the the
big learning curve for me. Aura-soma
offers aura or correct me bio field
treatments. Is that right? Please tell
more about this about aura-soma
treatments because we see the
vibrational health care rises up in
society and in development in healthcare
and we see more and more wellness
vibrational devices or potential.
Color definitely is a frequency and a
vibration and uh basically it's light
vibration because all the colors come
from pure white light and this is
something that has a very strong effect
on a person. Um when you say we're
offering treatments yes that's okay
various treatments which I don't want to
describe all now but uh what's really
important already as the name or soma
says it says aura and soma and it's the
connection between the aura the
energetic field of a person soma in many
many languages is the word for body
>> u material so it is the connection and how they inter are interactive the
uh the fields together with the body
because what's happening here is
actually an immaterial form what we
materialize through our body. The nice
thing as a method uh with aura-soma is that
you don't need to go for treatment. It's
wonderful to have it. It's very relaxing
and you can let go and you let somebody
else do it for you. You have an
interaction with somebody who's treating
you. But actually when you use pommander or a quintessence,
then you do it yourself. You have a
daily possibility of just by putting the
pommander a few drops into your energetic
field and go through the different
layers.
You do your own energetic treatment. And
what what's really nice, we have the
pommanders and the quintessences as
energetic treatment devices
is that the pommanders for the lower
energetic field. They really protect put
a protective shield into the aura which
um
>> provides energies to come to close. They
act like a filter.
>> And then the quintessence are more to
open you up for the spiritual level, for
>> the greater, for what is beyond
polarity.
And that's that's a really beautiful
thing. And when you do it in in your
everyday life, you have it as a routine
maybe for every day in the morning, in
the evening, depending on
what topic, what which is reflected in
the color. they need the most.
>> It's quite unique for aura-soma. I want
to back like this concept that you
described aura and soma
>> like body and our bio field and I see
like reflection to this concept like
matter and spirit. So from micro to
macro level
>> exactly
>> that we are all interconnected with the
universe.
>> So and I mean we have the chakras within the
body along the spine which are energy uh
bolts or centers within the body but
they reflect out into the aura and when
you put something into your aura that
the energy flow will come into the body.
So whatever you do in your aura will
have effect on on your physicality
with color and light
>> and color and light are actually
Consciousness. Light is consciousness.
And so we're working directly with
consciousness. Bringing consciousness to
the body means that has a reflection in
your everyday life. Awareness. Being
aware in the body what's happening
around me.
>> Amazing.
>> Yeah. It's it's a holistic concept.
We can hardly call our world very
harmonious and light in peace. Uh so
would you list three main issues in the
world and in the people that aura-soma
can definitely today can help can
support can facilitate.
Well, one of the most important things
uh for each and everybody is to
cultivate peace with themselves
like that inner peace that uh gives
tranquility and calm
and this is through meditation
for us especially through the color pale
blue uh which can be very helpful to be
in peace with self and everything and
everybody and up and below.
The next thing is the understanding of
cooperation.
It is uh we cannot live just as
individuals as much as individuality is
something to be appreciated because we
all have individual talents and gifts.
But these need to be spread into a
community which appreciates the
individual gifts and talents and not
this is mine or I take your idea and
this there's so much of this going on
>> really just uh the mutual appreciation
of one's gifts and talents and making
use of them together for something
better.
This is uh something I could really see
where each single aura-soma product will be
very helpful too. And the third thing is
distraction.
The world offers so many things
u that are unimportant
and uh they distract you from your own
being being with yourself being strong
within yourself.
Uh especially for young people I would
say it is so important that they are
guided to learn to distinguish between
what's important
what's offered out there and what is
really of essence and this is where aura-soma
can be very very helpful.
Tell some more words about current and
upcoming projects in Camelot.
>> Um
well we are always uh training new
practitioners. This is like the standard
because u it's necessary that we have
people out there in the country to be
available for people with the system.
And so this is something we regularly
do. And then there are kind of side
topics that we develop here at Camelot
specific uh topics that I personally
have a lot of interest in. And one of my
favorite topic is the connection to the
aseen tradition
>> which aura-soma
is very much rooted in. And this is
something I would really like to expand
on especially in the training
>> and I'm kind of in in my little chamber
developing something that I'm not yet
ready to speak about. Okay,
>> this would be for for the training part
of what's happening here. Otherwise
um as I said in the beginning we have to
go way back to the beginning which is
now over 35 years and um we're looking
into a generation shift at Camelot and
actually I'm very very lucky
my children both of my children have
grown up with aura-soma and
>> yeah it was there pretty early on in
their lives and my daughter is now more or
less leading the company in regard to
the everyday
duties and and business.
>> Congratulations.
>> Yeah.
What's your vision for the future of
Camelot? Let's say if I were visited you
in five years, what you wish I found?
I would wish especially for Aura-soma
since that this is our main topic
that we
of course everybody thinks of expansion
these days but uh it's not in the way
that it's about more sales or so what I
really would wish for that all our
activities here that we do in regard to
newslettering in regard to what I'm
writing in blogs that this is reached by
many many more people and especially
that Aura-soma
is being used by many many more people
which automatically would uh give us the
possibility here to hire more staff to
give more people a good livelihood and
in a surrounding of uh care because
we're really the the name Camelot is not
by accident in a way because uh the idea
of the round table of no hierarchy
um having meeting each other on eye
level was one of the main reasons why I
decided for the name Camelot for the
company. This will be an an ongoing red
thread all the way through. And the
young generation that I mentioned
earlier is uh
very much more on this track than years
ago. Yeah. Hierarchies not so important
anymore.
One would be this one 94 blue and
yellow. And I find it kind of
interesting because I'm a blue.
>> Yes, it's true. Such a resonance.
>> And way it's a polarity and a topic of
this bottle is
um Am I following my will or is there a
greater will that I follow? And but
whatever my will is will flow into the
greater
>> of the pale blue
>> the greater.
>> So this this yellow is really to be
kind of very precise with what I want
and because it has an effect every
little thing has an effect.
The pale coral. Yeah, pale coral shows a
lot of sensitivity
and like the corals how they live in the
sea. They they really build an entity
with many many other beings in the sea.
The corals protect the the
little fish from being eaten up. And
>> it's it's really a bottle about growing.
>> Thank you very much. It is my pleasure
and I thank you because hopefully this
is helping to spread aura-soma in the world
and this is what I have dedicated myself
to. So I'm very grateful for any help
that I have in spreading the word of Aura-soma.
