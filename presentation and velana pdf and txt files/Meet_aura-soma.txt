welcome welcome welcome
everybody so today I will tell you more
about aura-soma
system so here on the screen you can see
the
agenda and let's start from the
first point the history of aura-soma and
about vicky
wall the appearance of aura-soma system is
directly linked with the name of the
famous English healer Vicky wall created
by her in the 80s um of the 20th century
the first collection of these
multicolored
bottles with an incredibly attractive
power sparkling with the Splendor of
color and
light uh was the result of amazing
events of her life the starting point of
which was Vicky absolute faith and
expertise which allowed her to
understand the higher mind that speaks
the language of color and mother
nature color is light without which our
existence is Unthinkable at all do you
agree? we perceive color of course
naturally primarily through our vision
through our eyes but
subconsciously we absorb it through our
skin and the entire being color being a
wave in the physical sense penetrating
into our body and causes certain
biochemical reactions in tissues and
stimulates important glands and
normalizes and
heals by influencing our body color can
become its healer thus the science of
color healing is called color therapy
the best way to get to know Vicky wall
is to read her book the book calls the
miracle of color
healing following here are some facts
from Wiki's life Vicky was the first
female the fellow of the Royal College
of surgical
pathology Vicky was one of the first to
treat diabetes without
insulin Vicky's father was a special
person he taught her how to understand herbs
roots minerals plants and their medical
use both Vicky and her father they saw
people's aura she began her training in
the old school Pharmacy where she put
into practice the knowledge of
plants she received from her father and
later on Vicky met Margaret Cockbain who had
an osteopathi
clinic and they became a Partners
organizing a medical
center at 60 years old incredible fact
this woman had a professional life rich
in experience behind her which in one
way or another way was always devoted to
the health of people and caring for them
and by this time aura-soma
arose Vicky had to withdraw from active
professional life due to progressive
blindness and it seemed incredible
that and it seemed incredible that at
such elder age Vicky created these
colorful
bottles and this is absolutely
incredible that at such age with the
progressing blindness this woman
following her inner intuition created
this product with sparkling colors
indeed the intuitive development of Aura-soma
was the highest achievement of Vicky Wall
and she herself saw her Destiny in this
she brought to Aura-Soma not only her rich
personal and professional experience but
also the knowledge about nature and its
laws which her father told her about from
early childhood and she gained later on
at her professional practice in clinic
the transmitted knowledge
was the beginning of a chain of
significant and exciting events in her
life having a variety of natural
materials in her small laboratory one
night driven by inspired intuition Vicky
began alchemical work the results of
which was astonishing to herself already
in the morning Vickz and her friends
could admire the wonderful appeared first
bottles
the contents of which were only liquids
of different colors and shades and Vicki
had no answer to the question about the
purpose of these
bottles Vicky not only had no idea about
the capabilities of these substances but
also did not know the significance of
her discovery soon presenting her jewels
that's how she called these
bottles presented at various exhibitions Vicky began to receive more and
more surprises from the people it turned
out that the contents of the small
bottles produce a much more significant
effect than just Cosmetics thanks to her
innate gift of
seeing the deep layers of people's aura
Vicky noted a very important observation
for
herself people first of all choose a
bottle with the color in the so-called
core of aua of an individual person in other
words people choose a color that
resonated with their colors and state of
the
aura thanks to this vision of the aura
Vicky was able to describe the broad
effects of color
therapy thus she derived the key thesis
of
aura we are the colors that we choose
and these colors reflect the true needs
and essence of our inner being and agree
with me it's impossible to
formulate this effect more precisely
color supports a person to trust the
inner Light the inner guidance and
therefore now we come to mission and
values of aura-soma mission and values of our
system encourage people to their higher
self to the better version of themselves
also awakes importance and care of the
planet ecology mission and values of
aura-soma draw
attention to the inner
potential talents
energy and realization of each of us
because all followed the path of
Vicky Wall followed the truths of light and color
until the last days of her life after
Vicky left the research work was
continued by her assistant and friend
Mike Booth today he is the principal of Aura-soma
Academy in United
Kingdom the search for the secrets and
truths of the world is still
ongoing new pearls of the unique neckace
of our continue to be born up to this
day and this is an incredible and
inexplicable feeling and blessing of
belonging to this living stream
today there are
122
equilibriums behind every
bottle there is unique
story so pick up your bottle at 
personal consultation and find your
story color and light all products of
aura-soma are organic and natural and they
produced biodynamically aura-soma is non
intrusive non interfering it self Choice
based holistic
system it speaks of the growth of
Consciousness, of bringing balance
inner guidance, peace and understanding
to all levels of our body mind spirit
and
senses. It is a mean to help move towards
positive being and personal
growth towards auspicious changes on our
planet, innovations and
harmony for every being. Aura-soma
combines the art of aroma therapy and
herbal medicine through the use of
herbal extracts and essential
oils it combines the following three
kingdoms the mineral
kingdoms plant
kingdoms and realms of color and
light every aura-soma bottle combines these
three
realms the very concept of aura-soma means aura
light soma means body in Greek language
or
being on
Aramaic or Life Energy in
Sanskrit we can say therefore that aura-soma
means light
body Light Spirit
therefore working with aura-soma products
we develop our light Body. Aura-Soma we
can say it's an old Noble wine in a new
form Vicky said I searched and explored
the depths of time
nature innate wisdom and peace and I
discovered something that existed but
was long
forgotten something that was to be born
again in the new age in the new era the
concept of Aura-soma is closely related to
light and
color and it is a mirror of
Life. Light creates life and color
creates
vitality. Without light lives goes away
and without the color it becomes 
monotonous.A person's attitude towards
light and
color speaks about its own attitude
towards life
itself its
mission richness
abundance
meaningfulness love and light
